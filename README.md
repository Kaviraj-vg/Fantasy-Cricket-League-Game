# Fantasy-Cricket-League-Game
It is a Python GUI based project(pyqt5) where you can create a virtual team of real cricket players and score points depending on how your chosen players perform in real life match data.
# Approach
Each player has their own Points. 
There will be a limited no. of points to select 11 players, if we don't have enough points we can't select a player if his points are more and the team is evaluated using points of each player based on their performance internally. 
To win a tournament, we must try and get the maximum points and the No. 1 rank amongst other participants.
